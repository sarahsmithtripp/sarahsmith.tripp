I am an interdisciplinary ecosystem scientist interested in risk and resilience research. My PhD uses remote-sensing techniques, including satellite imagery and lidar (light detection and ranging) to model forest recovery (or lack of recovery) after large and high severity wildfire. I am to provide forest managers with accessible and accurate tools so they can take proactive steps to protect people and forests. Starting in 2025, I am seeking a private or government position working in policy development and scenario forecasting.

I am enthusiastic about science communication and am always looking for ways to engage the population. Please reach out if you are interested in a talk or research demonstration on drones, satellites, or forest science. I am also proficient in numerous statistical approaches and am always happy for #StatzChatz
