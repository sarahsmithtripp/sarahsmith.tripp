To investigate the relationship between disturbed forest canopies and climate I measured canopy height using a remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) and monitored microclimate with low-cost temperature and soil moisture sensors. I found growing season temperatures at -8 cm (soil), 0 cm (surface), and 15 cm (near-surface) relative to the ground surface were higher under shorter more disturbed canopies. Soil temperature was most sensitive to canopy height differences: linear models for the observed data range predicted a 2.0 °C increase in mean growing season soil temperature with every 10 m decrease in canopy height. There was observed a weak negative relationship between canopy height and mean growing season soil moisture. Importantly, we show canopy height summarized at moderate resolution (15 m) better explained differences in temperature in our disturbed landscape. This work informs future methods to produce gridded microclimate datasets and outlines the impact of disturbed forest structure on microclimate variables. Our results show that the characteristics of the forest canopy remaining after a burn impact microclimates, which has important implications for post-fire ecosystems.\n\n\n\nOrthoimagery of the my Masters Field Set-up Including the 90 Microclimate Loggers"

There are about 2 GB of photos, compressed to ~300 MB. The map with photos is about 500 MB, which is also too large for github pages. That’s okay, since I plan to host it on a different website devoted entirely to my father’s family history research."

And I’m able to spot errors and mistakes much more easily.\nCredit Card Fraud (Tableau)- I’ve been working on replicating the credit card fraud EDA in Tableau. I have an adequate draft, but I need to go back and fix the tooltips. There were some interesting results concerning the geographic variables. I made some assumptions when I did the modeling in R that weren’t correct. I will write up some lessons I learned while working in Tableau, but I also want to see how I could have caught that while working in R.\nCredit Card Fraud (Python)- I am rebuilding my credit card fraud project in Python to improve my skills. I’m also learning how to use Python within R Studio and the ins and outs of the reticulate package."

In this work I use lidar derived forest structure to correlate to spectral measurements from satellite metrics. I capitalize on the rapid expansion of lidar technology to develop structural metrics. For satellite metrics, I look at annual and seasonal composites to understand when a disturbance occurred and the spectral trajectory since the disturbance. My work supports the use of early spectral responses capture longer-term forest succession.\n\n\n\nSarah holding the M300 drone before collecting some Lidar data in Revelstoke BC"

My work investigated sediment and water flux into a local, and adored, on-campus pond (Paramecium pond for my fellow Wellesley humans).
