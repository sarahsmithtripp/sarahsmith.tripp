    "text": "While my PhD is large-scale, covering over 500,000 ha (that’s bigger than PEI and Connecticut), this large-scale research is antithetical to some of my undergraduate research projects on the 500 acre campus at Wellesley College. As the first interdisciplinary research assistant for the Wendy Paulon ’69 “Ecology of Place” https://www1.wellesley.edu/paulson initiative, facilitated research among Campus Administrators, Academics, and grounds staff. My work investigated sediment and water flux into a local, and adored, on-campus pond (Paramecium pond for my fellow Wellesley humans). The pond, fed by drinking water since built in the earth 20th century, is finally changing water sources in 2025 (a great example of slow-research!).\n\n\n\nInstalling the Thermistor Chain at Paramecium Pond\n\n\nAlongside my undergraduate research on Paramecium Pond I was also luck enough to conduct other on-campus work that fueled my fire passions. Below is a photo of me completing an experiment investigating the interaction between invasive species (Brome) and drought on early fire response\n\n\n\nBurning fire experiment at Wellesley College"

In this work I use lidar derived forest structure to correlate to spectral measurements from satellite metrics. I capitalize on the rapid expansion of lidar technology to develop structural metrics. For satellite metrics, I look at annual and seasonal composites to understand when a disturbance occurred and the spectral trajectory since the disturbance. My work supports the use of early spectral responses capture longer-term forest succession.\n\n\n\nSarah holding the M300 drone before collecting some Lidar data in Revelstoke BC"

    "text": "My master research included a full field season measuring microclimate dynamics in Interior British Columbia. The fire severity in this forest was variable, and highly related to the extent of burned canopy. Outputs from this research help forest managers understand microclimate - which can control fuel moisture content, young forest regeneration, and general forest growth."

To investigate the relationship between disturbed forest canopies and climate I measured canopy height using a remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) and monitored microclimate with low-cost temperature and soil moisture sensors. I found growing season temperatures at -8 cm (soil), 0 cm (surface), and 15 cm (near-surface) relative to the ground surface were higher under shorter more disturbed canopies. Soil temperature was most sensitive to canopy height differences: linear models for the observed data range predicted a 2.0 °C increase in mean growing season soil temperature with every 10 m decrease in canopy height. There was observed a weak negative relationship between canopy height and mean growing season soil moisture. Importantly, we show canopy height summarized at moderate resolution (15 m) better explained differences in temperature in our disturbed landscape. This work informs future methods to produce gridded microclimate datasets and outlines the impact of disturbed forest structure on microclimate variables. Our results show that the characteristics of the forest canopy remaining after a burn impact microclimates, which has important implications for post-fire ecosystems.\n\n\n\nOrthoimagery of the my Masters Field Set-up Including the 90 Microclimate Loggers"
